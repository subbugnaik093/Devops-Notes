Subject: Request for Handover of Marks Card to Parent

Dear Principal,
I am Subrahmanya studied in your collage in BCA bearing USN 19U12331 from 2019-2022, I am writing to request your assistance in arranging the handover of my marks card to my parent[mother].

I am currently unable to personally collect my marks card due to unavoidable circumstances as i am being out of town. Therefore, I kindly request that you consider allowing my parent/guardian to collect the marks card on my behalf.

To facilitate this process, I would like to provide the following details of my parent/guardian:

Name: Parvati Gopal Naik
Relation: Mother
Contact Number: 8762267719


I understand that there might be certain procedures or requirements in place to ensure the proper handover of academic documents. If there are any specific forms, authorization letters, or identification documents that need to be provided, please let me know, and I will be more than willing to complete them promptly.

I kindly request your cooperation and assistance in this matter. Your support in facilitating the handover of my marks card to my parent/guardian will be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your positive response and guidance on the further steps I need to take to ensure a smooth collection process.

Yours sincerely,
